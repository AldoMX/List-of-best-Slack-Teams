The ultimate list of 400+ Slack communities

Weâ€™re excited to see how communities on Slack are steadily growing day by day. People from different countries and backgrounds discuss a various range of topics in these communities. It is a source of valuable information and contacts we use every day at ReportChef to build one single tool to share progress and obstacles with your team in Slack. We decided to compose a list of Slack communities for your own good. It took Dmitry (analyst at ReportChef) several weeks and after he finished it on 22nd of Aug, the list contained 300 communities.
